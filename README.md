Essentially what this project does is based on how my Magic card collection is currently sorted.

I have two boxes of "Modern" cards, one is for the staples and the other is for the more fringe cards.

Rather than a subjective categorization where I make the judgment call it would make more sense to automate it, where at some percentile the distinction is made between Staple and Not Staple.

What I could do at a later date:
  Add card quantity
  More error testing
  "Popularity" score determined solely by modern decks
  
But for now I need to initialize a database, get it connected to the file, and at some point maybe host those things on a site like heroku? It would be nice for the program to have some sort of GUI but I'm just making sure it's possible for now.
